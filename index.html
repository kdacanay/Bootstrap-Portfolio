                          <p> My name is Ken Dacanay, and I am a second-generation Filipino, and the youngest of four boys.  My wife Jen 
                            and I have just celebrated our 10th anniversary, and, have just welcomed our first child into the world, Liliana Elise. </p>  
                            <p>I never really know what to write when you are asked to describe yourself.  I think the first few sentences were okay, but do they
                              really identify who I am? Of course not.  I've been to so many schools, attempting to achieve a degree that would maybe help define me and give me my 
                              purpose, but I never truly loved any direction I went, I just went for the easiest, common route.  I figured if I was good at it, I would like it and eventually
                              love it.  </p>
                            <p>I do identify myself as a musician, maybe an artist, but definitely a songwriter.  But a computer coder? A web developer?  Ten years ago, if you told me I would
                            be in a computer coding boot camp from Penn University, I would have laughed.  I barely know how to use an Ipod let alone my Iphone, and never knew the difference between
                            a Mac and a PC until like, five years ago.  But, it's funny how life works.  You never know what's around the corner.  </p>
                            <p>I got sick a few years ago and am now on social security benefits, but I also became a newly wide-eyed dad, and now found myself falling in love, for the first time, 
                              the direction I am now on: becoming a web developer. </p>
